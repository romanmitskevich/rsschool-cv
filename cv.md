## **About Me:**
I am a 3rd year student at the university and one day I realized that I want to know more. So I decided to join **RS School course** to gain knowledge in the field of front-end development. 

One of my best qualities is that I can spend a lot of time doing what *interests me*. I also work *well in a team* and like to *learn a lot* of new things. I believe that the courses combined with my *perseverance* and other qualities will help me become a good developer!

  for (let index = 2; index <= Math.sqrt(num); index++) {
    if (num % index === 0) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
